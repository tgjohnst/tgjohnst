# Hi! üëã

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My name is Tim (he/him). 

I'm a cloud-native computational biologist and maker with a passion for problem solving. My mission is to elevate biological intuition and knowledge with a mastery of informatics and systems engineering. As a dynamic technical leader, I'm known for deciphering esoteric technical challenges; flourishing in environments where I can architect systems, craft tools, streamline processes, and mentor and advocate for others to empower an exceptional team around me.

I'm motivated and fascinated by extracting, compiling, and presenting visual meaning from complex information. Scientifically, I'm most comfortable solving mysteries large and small in the world of nucleic acid biology: sequence processing, novel assay development, and algorithmic implementation. Documentation and reproducibility are not just checkboxes; they are the backbone of my analytical work. I find my sweet spot in engineering cloud resources, informatic tools, and robust automated systems to fuel massively parallel computational biology and machine learning.

## üìù My GitHub
I host a lot of random repos on GitHub - primarily a combination of bioinformatics, genAI experimentation, personal hardware projects, and home-automation related code and documentation. 

*Code hosted here is mostly either very old legacy and/or experiments done in spare moments here or there and doesn't represent my current style nor reproducibility/documentation practices when working on production code. The vast bulk of code I write for work is proprietary - for up-to-date code samples please contact me directly.*

If you have questions or requests on any repos, please feel free to add an issue and I'll do my best to address it.
