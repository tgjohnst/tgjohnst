### Hi there 👋

My name is Tim (he/him). 

I'm a computational biologist, data scientist, cloud architect, and general tinkerer. I host a lot of random repos on GitHub - primarily a combination of bioinformatics and home-automation related code and documentation. 

*Code hosted here is mostly either old legacy and/or experiments done in a moment here or there and doesn't represent my current code style or reproducibility/documentation practices when working on production code. The vast bulk of code I write for work is proprietary - for up-to-date code samples please contact me directly.*

If you have questions or requests on any repos, please feel free to add an issue and I'll do my best to address it. 

- 💬 **Ask me about:**
  - 🧬 Bioinformatics, especially Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) informatics
  - 🔌 Hobbyist microelectronics and smarthome devices
  - 🔬 Gene Therapies, Cancer Immunotherapy (CAR-T), RNA Editing, Synthetic Biology, etc
  - 🌐 Home networking
  - ☁️ Cloud architecture
