### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tim (he/him). 

I'm a computational biologist, data scientist, and general tinkerer. I host a lot of random repos on this github - primarily a combination of bioinformatics and home-automation related code and documentation. 

Code hosted here is mostly very old legacy and often doesn't necessarily represent my current coding style or skillset. Sadly, the vast bulk of code I write for work is proprietary. For up-to-date code samples please contact me directly. 

If you have questions or requests on any repos, please feel free to add an issue and I'll do my best to address it.
