### Hi there 👋

My name is Tim (he/him). 

I'm a computational biologist, data scientist, cloud architect, and general tinkerer. I host a lot of random repos on GitHub - primarily a combination of bioinformatics and home-automation related code and documentation. 

*Code hosted here is mostly very old legacy or experiments when I have a moment here or there and doesn't represent my current code style or reproducibility practices when working on production code. Sadly, the vast bulk of code I write for work is proprietary. For up-to-date code samples please contact me directly.*

If you have questions or requests on any repos, please feel free to add an issue and I'll do my best to address it. 

- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Bioinformatics, especially Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) informatics
  - Cancer immunotherapy (CAR-T), transcriptional & translational regulation, etc. I love translating biology and computer science concepts for folks with less of a background
  - Hobbyist microelectronics and smarthome devices
  - Home networking
  - Cloud architecture
- 📫 How to reach me: Create an issue here, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timjohnstone/)~~, or visit my (very out of date) website at www.timothyjohnstone.com~~
